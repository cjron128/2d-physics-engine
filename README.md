# 2D Physics Engine

A simple 2D physics engine built in C++ using SFML for rendering.

## Features
- Basic particle physics (gravity, velocity).
- Simple shapes (circle, rectangle).
- Basic collision detection (future work).

1. Install SFML.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Create a build directory:
   mkdir build && cd build
4. Run CMake:
   cmake ..
5. Build the project:
   make
6. Run the executable:
   ./2DPhysicsEngine
